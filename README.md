# Ballard ARINC 429 Custom Device

The **Ballard ARINC 429 Custom Device** allows use of [Astronics ARINC 429 PXIe Modules with Ballard Technology](http://www.ni.com/en-ca/shop/select/pxi-arinc-429-interface-module) in VeriStand. The custom device targets one **core** of a Ballard ARINC 429 PXIe module. To target multiple modules or multiple cores on the same module, use multiple instances of this custom device.

The custom device supports the following functionality:
- Import configuration files via scripting and System Explorer
- LabVIEW scripting of the custom device configuration
- Viewing read-only configuration in System Explorer
- Transmit and Receive configured labels
   - Scheduled and Acyclic labels
   - Multiple parameters per label
   - Multiple labels per channel
   - Multiple Rx and Tx channels per core
- Log all configured channels and labels per core

## Using the Custom Device

- Download the latest release package from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ni/niveristand-ballard-arinc429-custom-device/releases).
- See the [User Guide](Docs/User%20Guide/User%20Guide.md) for a walkthrough of using the Custom Device.
- See the [Parameters XML File Schema documentation](Docs/Parameters%20XML%20File/Parameters%20XML%20File.md) for configuring the custom device.

## Requirements

- PXI Linux RT Controller
- Supported Ballard ARINC 429 PXI Module

**Note**: Only NI-keyed PXI modules are supported by the custom device. The part number should have the form `LV-222-###-###`, were `###` stands for the core configuration. **441** and **442** core models are supported. See the mapping between NI and Ballard part numbers on [ni.com](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/documentation/supplemental/17/astronics-ballard-and-national-instruments-part-number-mapping.html).
